# Desktop: Getting Started

Language: [中文](/zh/desktop) | English

**pagent Desktop** is a desktop app that lets you chat with an AI and have it do real work on your computer. You describe a task in plain language; it reads and writes files, runs commands, and generates web pages or PDFs — with the results shown on the right side of the window.

This guide is for **first-time users**: from download to your first message, step by step. To work on the desktop source, see the [developer README](https://github.com/SyncLionPaw/pagent/blob/main/editors/desktop/README.md).

::: info The app UI is in Chinese
The desktop app currently ships **Chinese-only** UI. This guide keeps the on-screen Chinese labels in quotes (e.g. **新建任务** / New task) so you can match them to the buttons you actually see.

## What you need

- A **Mac (Apple Silicon, M1 or later)**. For Windows / Linux, see [Other systems](#windows-linux).
- An **API key** from a model provider (e.g. DeepSeek's `sk-...`). No key yet? The wizard points you to where to get one.
- About 10 minutes.

No coding required, and you don't need Docker up front.

---

## Step 1: Install the backend (required)

The desktop app is just the shell. The real work is done by a command-line program called `pagent`. Install it first.

Open **Terminal** (search "Terminal" in Launchpad) and run:

```bash
uv tool install pagent
```

**No `uv`?** `uv` is a small tool for managing Python environments. Install it first via the [install guide](./guide/install), then come back and run the command above.

When `pagent --help` prints help text, you're good.

::: warning Don't skip this
The app looks for the `pagent` command at startup. Without it, you'll see "cannot start backend."
:::

---

## Step 2: Download the app

Go to [pagent GitHub Releases](https://github.com/SyncLionPaw/pagent/releases) and download the latest:

- **macOS (Apple Silicon)** — named like `pagent-Desktop-<version>-mac-arm64.zip`

**Unzip** it and drag **pagent Desktop** into your **Applications** folder.

### macOS says the app is "damaged"?

![macOS dialog: pagent Desktop is damaged and can't be opened](/desktop/01-open-warning.png)

The app is **not** broken. Because it isn't signed with a paid Apple certificate, macOS blocks all "unidentified" apps this way. The fix is one line.

Open **Terminal** and run (adjust the path to where you installed it):

```bash
xattr -cr "/Applications/pagent Desktop.app"
```

Then open the app normally. The unzipped folder also contains **`打开说明.txt`** (open instructions).

::: details Why does this happen?
`xattr -cr` removes the "quarantine" flag macOS puts on downloaded files. This is standard for unsigned apps — many open-source tools need the same step. Right-click → **Open** sometimes works too, but often not for the "damaged" message, so prefer the command above.
:::

### Windows / Linux

macOS is the main published build for now. Windows / Linux packages are being rolled out through CI. Until then, you can:

- Use the [VS Code extension](./vscode) (cross-platform, same features), or
- Use the `pagent` command line directly.

---

## Step 3: Follow the setup wizard

The **first time** you open the app, if `pagent` isn't installed or no API key is set, a setup wizard (**首次设置** / Setup) opens automatically. It has three steps and the main UI stays locked until you finish — just follow along.

The top reads **完成下列步骤后即可开始使用。** (Complete the steps below to get started.)

### Step 1 — Environment (**环境**)

![Setup wizard step 1: checking uv and pagent CLI](/desktop/02-setup-env.png)

This checks whether `uv` and the `pagent CLI` are installed:

- Both show **已安装** (Installed) → you'll see **环境已就绪，可以继续。** (Environment ready). Click **下一步** (Next).
- Anything showing **需要安装** (Needs install) → click **安装 pagent** (Install pagent — the app does it for you), or **复制命令** (Copy command) to run it yourself, then **重新检测** (Re-check).

### Step 2 — API Key

![Setup wizard step 2: enter API key, model, base URL](/desktop/03-setup-apikey.png)

Enter your model **API Key** (looks like `sk-...`) and pick a **模型** (Model). Leave **Base URL（可选）** (optional) empty to use the default.

- If a key is **already detected**, the wizard says so — fill it in only to change it.
- The key is written to your local config file at `~/.pagent/pagent.toml`.

### Step 3 — Sandbox (**沙箱**)

![Setup wizard step 3: choose sandbox — local / container / remote](/desktop/04-setup-sandbox.png)

The "sandbox" is where the AI does its work. Pick **本机** (Local — recommended, no Docker); you can change it later per task. Click **完成** (Finish) to enter the app.

| Option | What it means | For whom |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **本机** (Local) | Isolated scratch workspace on this Mac, no Docker | Almost everyone (default) |
| **直接编辑** (inplace) | Edits the selected **项目目录** in place | Coding a git repo like a CLI |
| **容器** (Container) | Commands inside Docker/Podman; files stay in the thread workspace | Need a Linux image |
| **远程** (Remote) | SSH to another machine | GPU / HPC / remote toolchain |

These four are separate backends, not variants of inplace. Full map: [Choose a backend](/pagentv4/backends).

::: tip Want to configure later?
The wizard has **稍后配置** (Set up later) at the bottom to skip some steps. But you **must have an API key before sending a message**, or you'll get an error.
:::

You can reopen this wizard anytime from the bottom-left user menu → **首次设置** (Setup).

---

## Step 4: Create a task and send your first message

In the main window, click **新建任务** (New task) on the left.

![New task dialog: sandbox type, image, project folder](/desktop/06-new-task.png)

Fill in three things:

| Field | What to pick |
| --- | --- |
| **沙箱类型** (Sandbox) | Pick **本机** for an independent workspace, or **直接编辑** to modify the selected project folder in place |
| **镜像** (Image) | Only appears for **容器** (Container); a local pagent image like `pagent:latest` |
| **项目目录** (Project folder) | Click **浏览** (Browse) and pick the project for this task |

Click **创建会话** (Create session), type in the box at the bottom, and press **Enter** to send (**Shift+Enter** for a new line).

**直接编辑** works like starting a coding agent inside the project folder. File changes
take effect immediately, so keep the project under version control. In this mode, use
the **项目** panel to browse files; the separate **沙箱** tab is hidden.

Try saying:

> Create an index.html in this folder — a simple personal homepage

You'll watch the AI work step by step, and the generated page appears on the right.

## Get to know the main window

![Three panes: sessions, chat, files and artifacts](/desktop/05-main-window.png)

The window has three panes:

- **Left · Sessions** — every conversation is saved here; click one to continue. **新建任务** (New task) is at the top.
- **Center · Chat** — messages, the AI's steps, and the composer.
- **Right · Files & artifacts** — sandbox tree, project files, previews of generated pages/PDFs, and the run log.

Drag the dividers to resize. Press **⌘K** or the shortcuts button in the title bar to see all shortcuts.

### The composer

![Composer: send, YOLO lightning, ring, @ mention](/desktop/07-composer.png)

The placeholder reads **给 pagent 下达任务，输入 @ 引用文件** (Give pagent a task, type @ to reference a file). Key controls:

| Control | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Send / Stop** (发送 / 停止) | Send a message; becomes **停止** (Stop) while the AI runs, to cancel |
| **Lightning (YOLO)** | When on, tool calls are **auto-approved** — turn on only when you trust the task |
| **Ring** | Rough share of context used in this conversation |
| **@** | Type `@` to reference a file from your project or sandbox |

::: warning About YOLO (lightning)
By default the AI **asks for approval** before touching files or running commands. YOLO turns that off and **auto-approves everything** — fast but risky. Only enable it when you're sure the task is safe.
:::

### Right side: files & artifacts

![Right panel: file tree, artifact preview, log](/desktop/08-artifacts.png)

Generated pages, PDFs, and images preview right here. The file tree shows everything in the sandbox and project, and the log shows what the backend is doing — **check here first when something goes wrong**.

---

## Everyday tasks

### Delete a session

In the session list, hover a session and click the **删除会话** (Delete session) icon. A confirmation appears:

![Delete session confirmation dialog](/desktop/09-delete-confirm.png)

It reads **删除「session title」后无法恢复，确认删除吗？** (Deleting "…" can't be undone — delete it?). Click **删除** (Delete) to confirm, or **取消** (Cancel). **This can't be undone**, so double-check first.

### Switch / resume sessions

Click any session on the left to switch to it. On startup, the app tries to **resume your most recent session** automatically.

---

## Settings & help

![Settings panel: environment health lights + disk usage](/desktop/10-settings.png)

| Entry | What's inside |
| --- | --- |
| Title bar **Gear** (设置 / Settings) | **环境自检** (Environment health — status lights for uv / pagent / API key / container) + **磁盘占用** (Disk usage) + view `pagent.toml` |
| Title bar **Book** (文档 / Docs) | Open this documentation site in the browser |
| User menu **扫码看文档** (Scan for docs) | QR code to read the docs on your phone |
| User menu **首次设置** (Setup) | Reopen the three-step setup wizard |

The config shown in Settings is **read-only**. To change the model or advanced options, edit `~/.pagent/pagent.toml` in a text editor.

::: details Prefer to configure the key manually?
**Option 1 · Environment variable:**

```bash
export DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**Option 2 · Config file (recommended):** create `~/.pagent/pagent.toml`:

```toml
[provider.deepseek]
kind = "deepseek"
api_key = "sk-..."
model = "deepseek-v4-flash"

[agent]
provider = "deepseek"
```

More providers: [Providers & API keys](./guide/providers).

## Where your files live

```text
~/.pagent/
├── pagent.toml       # your API key and model
├── threads/          # all conversation history
└── skills/           # optional local skills

<your project folder>/
└── artifacts/        # files the AI generated (HTML, etc.)
```

::: danger Protect your key
`pagent.toml` holds your real API key. **Don't** share it or commit it to Git.
:::

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Try |
| --- | --- |
| "Damaged, can't be opened" | Run `xattr -cr "/Applications/pagent Desktop.app"` |
| Backend / Bridge won't start | Run `uv tool install pagent`, then check the log on the right |
| Error after sending | Check the key in `pagent.toml`, or set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Settings says "no config file" | Create `~/.pagent/pagent.toml` as above |
| Tool stuck on "running" | Tap **Stop**, or send another message |

---

## Going further

- **Connect to a remote server**: the desktop app can talk to a remote `pagent` server instead of a local one (share sessions across devices). This is an advanced setup requiring transport configuration — see the repo docs.
- [VS Code extension](./vscode) — the same AI inside VS Code, cross-platform.
- [Install guide](./guide/install) — start here if you don't have `uv` yet.
